## Introduction

After shifting into my new home, we enjoyed the honeymoon period for about 4 - 6 weeks. After that, we needed to settle in and figure out the proper workflows on how we can actually get things done within our house (no longer feel like a holiday home ><).

Predominantly working from home, setting up my home workspace was one of the most important things. So I got started on it, which includes setting up my Desk, Monitors, Keyboards and other necessary peripherals.

Whilst giving my Mechanical Keyboard a wipe, I noticed that the Mechanical keyboard was not at it's most hygienic state haha.

So this calls for some heavy duty cleaning.
