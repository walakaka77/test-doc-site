# Behaviour Modification Fundamentals

In this section, we try to specify the theory behind the application of the behaviour modification techniques that are applied to dogs. Most of the techniques are rooted in the principles of _operant conditioning_. Operant conditioning is a field in psychology that focuses on modifying behaviour through consequences.

## Introduction to Operant Conditioning Concepts

Operant conditioning is a fundamental concept in the field of psychology, particularly in understanding how behavior is shaped and modified through consequences. Unlike classical conditioning, which focuses on involuntary responses to stimuli, operant conditioning deals with voluntary behaviors and the consequences that follow them.

In simple terms, operant conditionins is about learning through reward and punishment. When a behavior is followed by a desirable consequence, it becomes more likely to be repeated in the future. Conversely, when a behavior is followed by an undesirable consequence, it becomes less likely to be repeated.

### Key Concepts of Operant Conditioning

These fundamental concepts form the backbone of operant conditioning theory, providing insight into how behavior can be influenced and modified:

1. **Positive Reinforcement:** Adding a favorable stimulus to increase the likelihood of a behavior recurring.
   
2. **Negative Reinforcement:** Removing or avoiding an aversive stimulus to increase the likelihood of a behavior recurring.
   
3. **Positive Punishment:** Adding an aversive stimulus to decrease the likelihood of a behavior recurring.
   
4. **Negative Punishment:** Removing a rewarding stimulus to decrease the likelihood of a behavior recurring.

Operant conditioning principles have significant implications across various domains, including education, therapy, parenting, and organizational behavior management. Understanding these concepts is crucial for comprehending how behavior is shaped and controlled in different contexts -- for us dog behaviour modification and dog handling.


## Positive Reinforcement

Positive reinforcement is a behavioral principle in operant conditioning where a desirable stimulus is presented to increase the likelihood of a specific behavior recurring in the future. In technical terms, it involves the addition of a reinforcing stimulus following a behavior that makes it more likely that the behavior will occur again in the future.

### Technical Details:

Positive reinforcement involves the addition of a favorable stimulus immediately following a desired behavior, thereby strengthening the likelihood of that behavior being repeated. This process relies on the principle of reinforcement, where the desired behavior is rewarded, increasing the probability of its recurrence. 

**Example:**<br>
Giving a treat to a dog when it sits on command to encourage the dog to sit more often.

![image showing a dog being given a treat when it's sitting down obediently as instructed by the owners](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn-origin-etr.akc.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/16150115/Siberian-Husky-being-trained-with-a-treat-outdoors.jpg){:width="50%"}

- Desired Behaviour: Dog sitting down
- Reward: Dog Receiving the treat

## Negative Reinforcement

Negative reinforcement is another concept in operant conditioning applied to dog training where a certain behavior is strengthened by the removal or avoidance of an unpleasant stimulus. It involves the termination or avoidance of an aversive stimulus to increase the probability of a specific behavior occurring in the future.

### Technical Details:

Negative reinforcement in dog training involves the removal or avoidance of an aversive stimulus contingent upon the occurrence of a desired behavior, leading to an increase in the frequency of that behavior. This process operates on the premise that the removal of the aversive stimulus serves as a reinforcing consequence, strengthening the likelihood of the targeted behavior.

**Example:**<br>
A dog stops moving forward to avoid the discomfort of a tight leash pull.

![Image of a dog pulling against the leash](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRRYWkS6wOBtwi9lV7Z9otb8w0N3Ka59xB2f9l3Ey6MsWNXS6kVfOyvGHcoOWbbeDOwn1g&usqp=CAU){:width="50%"}

- Application of aversive stimulus: Tightening of the leash
- Desired Behaviour: Stop the dog from pulling and moving forward
- Removal of aversive stimulus: Relaxation of the leash tension

## Positive Punishment

Positive punishment is a concept in operant conditioning applied to dog training where an aversive stimulus is added following an undesired behavior, decreasing the likelihood of that behavior recurring in the future. It involves the application of an unpleasant consequence to suppress or eliminate an undesirable behavior.

### Technical Details:

Positive punishment in dog training entails the presentation of an aversive stimulus immediately after an undesirable behavior occurs, with the aim of reducing the frequency of that behavior in the future. By associating the undesirable behavior with an unpleasant consequence, positive punishment aims to deter the occurrence of the behavior.

**Example:**<br>
A dog receives a verbal reprimand after jumping on a visitor.

![image of dog receiving verbal scolding from it's owner](https://blog.ferplast.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/cane-come-si-sgrida-regole-errori.jpg){:width="50%"}

- Desired behaviour: Cease jumping on visitors
- Application of aversive stimulus: Verbal reprimand when the dog jumps

## Negative Punishment

Negative punishment is a behavioral principle in operant conditioning applied to dog training where a desirable stimulus is removed following an undesired behavior, decreasing the likelihood of that behavior happening again in the future. It involves the removal or withholding of a rewarding stimulus to decrease the probability of a specific behavior occurring.

### Technical Details:

Negative punishment in dog training involves the removal of a rewarding stimulus contingent upon the occurrence of an undesirable behavior, resulting in a decrease in the frequency of that behavior over time. This process operates on the principle that the removal of a valued stimulus serves as a consequence for the undesirable behavior, leading to its suppression.

**Example:**<br>
A dog loses access to a favorite toy after chewing on furniture.

![image of an owner trying to confiscate a ring toy from the dog](https://previews.123rf.com/images/kkolosov/kkolosov1808/kkolosov180800132/107726481-hand-of-anonymous-person-trying-to-taking-away-ring-toy-from-cute-dog-while-playing-in-park-on-sunny.jpg){:width="50%"}

- Desired behaviour: Stop chewing on furniture
- Removal of valued stimulus: Temporarily taking away the toy

These four principles—positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, positive punishment, and negative punishment—play crucial roles in shaping behavior through operant conditioning, influencing the likelihood of specific behaviors recurring in the future.

## Thank you!

As you go along this section, you will realized that most if not all of the techniques applied are based off these principles. I personally find it fascincating! Also, understanding these concepts definitely helps me have a deeper appreciation regarding why the technique is applied, and when it is appropriate to apply.

Hope it does the same for you guys too ^^, and do let me know if there are important information or inaccuracies that have been missed out!

Thanks, Peace and Love!<br>
