# Introduction!
Hello people! Here, we are trying to create a profile for each willing friend, acquaintance, colleauge etc. that are willing to get features. That way, we can spice up the this journey by including the aspirations of other people as it could get quite mundane talking about myself all the time. 

This section was actually an idea given to me by amazing co-workers ^^. They jokingly mentioned that they should be featured in the blog, and since then - I have convinced myself that featuring others would actually be a sick idea :D.

## Plan for this section
Now that we have an idea of what we are going to add into this section, we'll need some tips for the next step. The current plan is as follows:

- We will reach out to a bunch of pals, whom are willing to be interviewed
- Proceed with the interview (line of questions to be defined)
- An interview-styled arcticle can be generated for each willing individual
- Each individual can ofcourse review the content to ensure accuracy before it goes out (don't want to get sued -- kidding!)
- Publish the articles, seek feedback and iterate

This is probably an on-going effort, so let's see. It does make things abit more exciting to engage in others in this adventure of `trying to make it` in life ^^

## Potential Line of Questioning

Currently, we are brainstorming for the list of questions that could be asked

### Ice Breaker Questions
- Tell me more about yourself
- What are your hobbies, and past-time

### Tactical Aspirations
- Any short-term milestones that you are planning to achieve in the next year
- Any mid-term milestones that you are planning to achieve in the next 2.5 years

### Philosophical Inspiration
- What would you say are your values in life?
- If there is one thing you could change in life, what would it be?


### <colleague's-name> Questions
I just recalled that there is a colleague with a bunch of thought provoking question. Rather than re-invent the wheel, I might as well seek his permission to re-use his deck of cards:
- The interview would comprise of drawing 10 cards, and answering the questions back-to-back
- Each answer, would dive into a conversation that would be translated into the interview-styled article

To update this sub-section once approval from <colleague's-name> is received.

## Thank you!

For those who made this far, thanks a bunch for reading. Willing guinea pigs -- please reach out. Non-willing guinea pigs, do share your thoughts and ideas to spice up this section (or the whole blog in general).

Peace and Love<br>
