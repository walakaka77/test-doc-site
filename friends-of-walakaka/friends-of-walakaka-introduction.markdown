# Introduction!
Hello people! This section was actually an idea give to my beautiful colleagues from work. 

They have jokingly requested to be included in the blog, but there is no smoke without fire - and every joke has some truth ^^.

And even if it were not true, I have now convinced myself that this is a sick idea!

## Plan for this section
So this section will aim to share profiles of my existing friends or family. Colleagues fall under the category of frineds.

At the time of writing, I am thinking of the following:
- An interview styled articles for each individual.
- Research what line of questioning that podcasters such as Joe Rogan etc. come up with before their episodes
- Test it out with a few guinea pigs (some willing friends)
- And write up the discussion in the interview styled article

This is probably an on-going effort, so let's see. It does make things abit more exciting to engage in others in this adventure of `trying to make it` in life ^^

So stay tuned, and let's go!

Peace and Love<br>
