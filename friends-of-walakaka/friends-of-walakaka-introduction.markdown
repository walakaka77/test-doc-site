# Introduction!
Hello people! Here, we are trying to create a profile for each willing friend, acquaintance, colleauge etc. that are willing to get features. That way, we can spice up the this journey by including the aspirations of other people as it could get quite mundane talking about myself all the time. 

This section was actually an idea given to me by amazing co-workers ^^. They jokingly mentioned that they should be featured in the blog, and since then - I have convinced myself that featuring others would actually be a sick idea :D.

## Plan for this section
Now that we have an idea of what we are going to add into this section, we'll need some tips for the next step. The current plan is as follows:

- We will reach out to a bunch of pals, whom are willing to be interviewed
- Proceed with the interview (line of questions to be defined)
- An interview-styled arcticle can be generated for each willing individual
- Each individual can ofcourse review the content to ensure accuracy before it goes out (don't want to get sued -- kidding!)
- Publish the articles, seek feedback and iterate

This is probably an on-going effort, so let's see. It does make things abit more exciting to engage in others in this adventure of `trying to make it` in life ^^

## Line of Questioning

To make it more interesting, I have a friend (Kurien) that designed a thought provoking game -- `Let's Talk`. To prevent ourselves from re-inventing the wheel, we will play the `Let's Talk` game to generate the content for the article. The game is simple:
1. Randomly draw a thought provoking question
2. Say what comes to your mind based on the question
3. The remaining conversatinos that arise is free-play. Let's see how far we go ^^
4. For starters, we can target to go through 10 questions?

For more details regarding the questions avaialble, do check it out at [Let's Talk](https://www.kuriensk.co/lets-talk)


Credits to Kurien for designing the `Let's Talk` game! Personally experienced this multiple times, and never had a boring conversation.

## Thank you!

For those who made this far, thanks a bunch for reading. Willing guinea pigs -- please reach out. Non-willing guinea pigs, do share your thoughts and ideas to spice up this section (or the whole blog in general).

Right now, I have no friends -- but just you wait, the list would grow (hopefully...)!

Test adding some changes, to check if I can push from my new mac

Peace and Love<br>
