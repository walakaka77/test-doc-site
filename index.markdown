# Introduction

This site aims to take you through the experience of a new dog owner. This should serve to help new dog owners to identify and pre-empt many catch-22 scenarios.

## Sections

The section will comprise of the following details:
- Owner profile
- Dog profile
- Foundation of dog training and psychology
- Practical applications of behaviour modification techniques
- Case studies of positive and negative examples

## How to navigate the document

To get a comprehensive understanding of the behaviour modification techniques, one would need to understand the context of the dog and the owner. 
That can be achieved by going through the `dog profile` and `owner profile`.

The `Foundation of dog training and psychology` section would specify the fundamental drivers of dog behaviour. With this understanding, one would be able to have an appreciation of the the different factors that can be applied to inspire or deter behaviours.

The `Practical applications of behaviour modification techniques` provides real life applications of the theories that was specified in the previous section. 

The `Case studies` section will share anecdotal scenarios of positive and negative cases. This aims to share the complexity of applying behaviour modification techniques in a real world scenario - where there are multiple factors that are driving the dogs behaviour.

## Questions and Feedback

Please feel free to reach out to test@gmail.com if you have any further clarifications or feedback. As someone who has never had any experience with dogs -- the aim is to share as much knowledge as possible, and it would be for everyone's benefit if the site could be improved.
