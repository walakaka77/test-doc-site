# Welcome!
Hello Friends! This is Shafik, another guy around the block trying to make it in life, and have abit of fun whilst doing so. This is an introductory page, which give you guys an insight to the motivations of starting this blog.

For those of you who know me you'd know I've been off social media and people stalk me by checking my wife's instagram. And for those who doesn't know me -- fingers crossed this blog let's you know me a little better (for better or for worst lol). So here goes!

## Background
So, repeating what I mentioned above -- just your everyday joe trying to make it in life, stuck in the rat race. Having been in the professional world for 5 years, there has been an intense focus of `trying to make it`. Most of my hours are spent on work, and some would say I neglected my personal life.

But sad to say, change is the only constant. And I've recently:
1. Shifted into a new home
2. Gotten a new dog
3. And to top it off, my wife has spun off her own business

These changes (not been there for very long), forced me to reprioritize my time and focus away from professional work. Resulting in less time for activities that gain you experience such as:
- Learning on the job
- Obtaining certifications
- Completing tasks to achieve deliverables

And that is why I created this blog! In the spirit of `trying to make it` in life lol -- I have decided to share my life experiences, so that I can capture all these off the job skillsets that I am picking up. Also, being lackluster in my social media presence, this might perhaps make up for that digital footprint in the internet or interweb etc.

There has also been a big push for documentation at my workplace lately, so I'll start by documenting my life.

As a project manager, I have a plan for this blog. And as a project manager, I also know that the plan normally never works. But nevertheless, failing to plan is planning to fail - so here is my plan:

## The Plan for my Blog
A short breakdown of how this blog is planned to be structured:

1. **Easing into my New Home:** This section will detail experiences of moving into my new home. Secret, my new home is at Kallang Breeze.

2. **The Canine Chronicles of Kallang Breeze:** And This section will detail experiences of bringing up a new dog. For someone with zero dog experience -- think we can expect a zero-to-hero styled section here.

3. **IT Support for an Entrereneur:** No prizes for the best guess here -- yes the entrepreneur is my wife. And it's I do my due diligence as a good husband to help wherever I can.

4. **My Professional Journey:** Could not resist slipping in some credibility. All in the spirit of `trying to make it`.

5. **Tech Related Shenanigans:** This will take you guys through the tech world from my personal lenses -- coming from a non-tech background. Would be interesting to see how this section pans out.

6. **Personal Experiences:** And this section will detail personal experiences such as meditation, mental health, productivity and much more. Essentially, anything that cannot fit into the other categories will come to this section -- can't go wrong since this section is personal to me haha!

## Thank you!
Lastly, if you guys made it this far, I'd like to thank you guys for reading. Please feel free to give us feedback -- constructive criticism please, no haters because my heart can't take it.

But yes - thank you ^^. Been a pleasure writing this, and hope it was a pleasure reading it too.

Oh - and I'm also not planning on updating this page. So this was written on `18 Jan 2024`. Would be cool to look back and see where this is at in the future.

Peace and Love<br>
Shafik Walakaka
