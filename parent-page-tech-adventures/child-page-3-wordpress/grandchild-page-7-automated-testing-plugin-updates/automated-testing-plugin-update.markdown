We previously wrote an article on how much I hate updating plugins on wordpress:
- Need to update weekly
- After that need to test because site might break

This takes valuable time, and honestly -- testing weekly just became too painful i stopped updating plugins frequently.

## Issue

Recently though, a missed plugin udpate caused my site to break -- or, possibily? We still don't know the root cause but missing plugin updates can cause security issues etc., and is in general just pure bad practice lol.

So, I've finally set up some sort of automated testing. Not fully -- just accessing the URLs, and then taking a screenshot. See sample of the screenshots that playwright has taken for me:
![inspect screenshots taken by playwright](../../parent-page-tech-adventures/child-page-3-wordpress/grandchild-page-7-automated-testing-plugin-updates/inpect-screenshots-by-playwright.png)

At least, by doing so -- I don't need to access every single page, wait for it to load and then inspect it.

So, how did I do it?

## Playwright

Playwright is a microsoft developed tool to help you automate testing. At my workplace, we use it extensively -- and professionals script it.

For me -- I'm just fooling around with it to get familiar with the tool.

You can check out my [full playwright script here!](https://gitlab.com/walakaka-group/pet-coach-sg-automated-testing/-/blob/main/tests/staging-petcoach-sg.spec.ts)

I'll step down what I've done for your reference:

### Set the constants to get the URLs from the sitemap

As all the URLs are available in the sitemaps, I set the constants here! The constants consists of:
- Sitemap URLs
- response from the sitemap URLs
- The text from the sitemap URLs response. This is in xml format
- Parse for the xml
- The variable to store the combined URL: `urls`

```typescript
    // Set URL constants
    const sitemapUrl = 'https://staging.petcoach.sg/page-sitemap.xml';
    const sitemapUrl2 = 'https://staging.petcoach.sg/post-sitemap.xml';

    // Fetch both XML files
    const response = await request.get(sitemapUrl);
    const response2 = await request.get(sitemapUrl2);

    // Extract XML content
    const xml = await response.text();
    const xml2 = await response2.text();


    // Parse XML data
    const parser = new xml2js.Parser();

    // Merging URLs from both sitemaps into one array
    const urls: string[] = [];
```

### Retrieve the URLs from both sitemaps

Then I parse both sitemaps and extract the URLs, and store them in `urls`:

```typescript
    // Parse the first sitemap (page-sitemap.xml)
    parser.parseString(xml, (err, result) => {
    if (err) {
      console.error('Failed to parse XML:', err);
      return;
    }
    
    // Extract URLs
    const urls1 = result.urlset.url.map((url: any) => url.loc[0]);
    console.log('Extracted URLs:', urls1);

    // Merge with the combined urls array
    urls.push(...urls1); // Spread the URLs from page-sitemap.xml into the urls array
    });




      // Parse the second sitemap (post-sitemap.xml)
  parser.parseString(xml2, (err, result) => {
    if (err) {
      console.error('Failed to parse XML for post-sitemap.xml:', err);
      return;
    }
    // Extract URLs from the post sitemap
    const urls2 = result.urlset.url.map((url: any) => url.loc[0]);
    console.log('Extracted URLs from post-sitemap.xml:', urls2);

    // Merge with the combined urls array
    urls.push(...urls2); // Spread the URLs from post-sitemap.xml into the urls array
  });

```

### Playwright accesses each URL and takes a screenshot

```typescript
    // Access each URL sequentially and check page accessibility
    for (let i = 0; i < urls.length; i++) {
         //if (i === 3) break; // Break the loop after 5 URLs
        const url = urls[i];

        
        const context = await browser.newContext(); // âœ… New browser context per URL
        const page = await context.newPage();

        try {
        // Access the URL in the browser
        console.log(`Accessing URL: ${url}`);

        await Promise.race([
          (async () => {
            console.log("promise race block starting...");
            const pageResponse = await page.goto(url, { waitUntil: 'networkidle' });
            // await page.goto(url, { waitUntil: 'load' }); // Wait until the DOM is loaded
            // await page.goto(url, { waitUntil: 'networkidle' }); // Wait until the network is idle

            await page.waitForTimeout(10000); // Wait for 10 seconds between requests
            await scrollToBottom(page); // ðŸ‘ˆ smooth scroll added here
            await scrollToTop(page); // scroll back to the top for the screenshot
            
            // Derive a clean path from the URL
            const urlObj = new URL(url);
            let pathname = urlObj.pathname.replace(/^\/|\/$/g, ''); // Trim slashes
            if (!pathname) pathname = 'home'; // Fallback for root path `/`

            const safePath = pathname.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9\-]/g, '-'); // Sanitize filename
            const fileName = `${i + 1}-${safePath}.png`;

            // Take screenshot after loading the page
            //await page.screenshot({ path: `staging-screenshots/${i + 1}-screenshot.png`, fullPage: true });
            await page.screenshot({ path: `staging-screenshots/${fileName}`, fullPage: true });

            // Get the response status
            if (pageResponse) {
              const status = pageResponse.status();
              console.log(`Status for ${url}:`, status);
            } else {
              console.log(`No response received for ${url}`);
            }

            // Perform assertion to ensure the page is accessible (status code 200)
            expect(pageResponse.status()).toBe(200);

            const title = await page.title();
            expect(title.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
          })(),

          new Promise((_, reject) =>
          setTimeout(() => reject(new Error(`Timeout after ${TIMEOUT_MS / 1000} seconds`)), TIMEOUT_MS)
          )
        ]);

        } catch (error) {
            console.error(`Error while testing ${url}:`, error);
        }
```

### Needed to scroll up, down

Needed to scroll up and down as some images are only loaded when you scroll over them
```typescript
    await page.waitForTimeout(10000); // Wait for 10 seconds between requests
    await scrollToBottom(page); // ðŸ‘ˆ smooth scroll added here
    await scrollToTop(page); // scroll back to the top for the screenshot
```

### Store the screenshots for review

I store the screenshots for my review later -- playwright does the heavy lifting, and I just check it out:

```typescript
    // Derive a clean path from the URL
    const urlObj = new URL(url);
    let pathname = urlObj.pathname.replace(/^\/|\/$/g, ''); // Trim slashes
    if (!pathname) pathname = 'home'; // Fallback for root path `/`

    const safePath = pathname.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9\-]/g, '-'); // Sanitize filename
    const fileName = `${i + 1}-${safePath}.png`;

    // Take screenshot after loading the page
    //await page.screenshot({ path: `staging-screenshots/${i + 1}-screenshot.png`, fullPage: true });
    await page.screenshot({ path: `staging-screenshots/${fileName}`, fullPage: true });
```

### See sample screenshots generated by playwright

You can see example [screenshots generated by playwright here!](https://gitlab.com/walakaka-group/pet-coach-sg-automated-testing/-/tree/main/staging-screenshots?ref_type=heads)

Now that we have the screenshots, my plugin update flow no longer requires me to do manual testing lol.

## Revised Steps

Now, my update steps are straightforward!

1. Firstly, update the staging site:
![Update staging site plugin](../../parent-page-tech-adventures/child-page-3-wordpress/grandchild-page-7-automated-testing-plugin-updates/update-staging.png)
2. To ensure no caching issues, I purged all the cache
  - Elementor cache -- regenerate all css and files in elementor
  ![purge elementor cache](../../parent-page-tech-adventures/child-page-3-wordpress/grandchild-page-7-automated-testing-plugin-updates/purge-elementor-cache.png)
  - Purge litespeed cache
  ![Purge litespeed cache](../../parent-page-tech-adventures/child-page-3-wordpress/grandchild-page-7-automated-testing-plugin-updates/purge-litespeed-cache.png)
  - Purge cloudflare cache
  ![Purge cloudflare cache](../../parent-page-tech-adventures/child-page-3-wordpress/grandchild-page-7-automated-testing-plugin-updates/purge-cloudflare-cache.png)
3. Next, I run the script and get screenshots of the staging site that I can manually inspect:
![Inspect playwright screenshots](../../parent-page-tech-adventures/child-page-3-wordpress/grandchild-page-7-automated-testing-plugin-updates/inpect-screenshots-by-playwright.png)

I just repeat the same flow for production, but now the script points to the production site instead of the staging site!

## Conclusion, Benefits

Benefits are that now -- I no longer have to manually access each individual URL.
And Litespeed, it caches the html document -- but only after you access it.

Previously, I had to access each individual pages, so that the doc is generated, and cached server side.
However, now -- playwright does it for me. When I access the page, it's already blazing fast ;)!!
