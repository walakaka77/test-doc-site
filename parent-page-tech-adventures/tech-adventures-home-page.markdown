# Tech Adventures!
Hello! Welcome the Tech Adventures section, where you can view the technological world from the lens of a non-techy individual.

In doing so, hoping that you guys would also reach out to me and share regarding some of the best practices or your personal experience with the different technologies.

## Elaboration
So there's a bunch of geeking out that I do during my own free time, including the creation of this blog. And here is the chance for me to share it with you.

Check it out, let me know if there are things that can be done better. Let me know if it's already the best (always nice to have that ego boost LOL). But on top of everything, please enjoy the read ^^.

Peace and Love<br>
Shafik Walakaka
